Deploying Network Security as a managed service requires only a few steps and has no overhead management during or after deployment. With managed service, the traffic in your environment is routed through Network Security endpoints to be inspected. The only items you manage are the Network Security endpoints in your cloud environment; the virtual appliances, as well as any additional infrastructure requirements, are managed by Network Security.

- Navigate to the **AWS Console > VPC**.
- Under Virtual Private Cloud, click **Route Tables**.
- Click **Create route table**.
